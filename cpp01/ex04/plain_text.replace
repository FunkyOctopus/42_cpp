In comput??g, pla?? text is a loose term for data (e.g. file contents) that represent only characters of readable 
material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (float??g-po??t numbers, images, etc.). It may also 
??clude a limited number of "whitespace" characters that affect simple arrangement of text, such as spaces, l??e breaks,
or tabulation characters (although tab characters can "mean" many different th??gs, so are hardly "pla??"). Pla?? text 
is different from formatted text, where style ??formation is ??cluded; from structured text, where structural parts of 
the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the like are identified; and from b??ary files ?? which some portions 
must be ??terpreted as b??ary objects (encoded ??tegers, real numbers, images, etc.).
